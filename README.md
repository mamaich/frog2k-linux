# SF2000 Linux Bring-Up

<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT -->

This project is the Linux bring-up workspace for the SF2000, GB300, DY12, and
related HC15xx/SF2000-family handhelds. The first hardware target is SF2000.

The goal is a small, fast iteration loop:

1. build the SF2000 NOMMU kernel and direct soft-float userspace;
2. boot the same ASD in the sibling `sf2000_qemu` board model;
3. verify the physical display, SD, input, audio, and retained-log contracts.

Generated files stay under `build/`. Large vendor trees are referenced through
local links instead of copied into this repository.
`sdcard-linux` also writes `build/sdcard/SHA256SUMS`; verify the files again
after copying them to removable media when a staged and direct ASD appear to
behave differently.

## Local References

- `../sf2000_qemu`: separate emulator checkout used for bring-up. Set
  `QEMU_DIR` if it lives elsewhere.
- `external/hclinux/2024.02.y.2`: optional Hichip driver/platform reference;
  it is not part of the direct build graph.
- `/root/host-frogdev/universal/sf2000_hcrtos`: HC15xx HCRTOS/AVP board data.
- `../UniFrog`: UniFrog firmware and frontend checkout used by the QEMU smoke.
- `../unifrog-hcrtos-sdk`: standalone vendor SDK; its `lib/vendor` archives
  are the source for optional GE ABI tests. If that sibling checkout is
  absent, `make hcrtos-sdk` clones the pinned public `260819_1` branch into
  `.deps/unifrog-hcrtos-sdk` and verifies the exact commit before use. Set
  `HCRTOS_SDK_DIR` to an existing checkout when keeping the SDK elsewhere.

## Current Strategy

The HCLinux tree has useful Linux support for HC16xx, but not a ready HC15xx
Linux board port. We use it as driver and platform reference while keeping the
initial SF2000 target small:

- MIPS32r1 little-endian, soft-float and no-MMU.
- The pinned prebuilt `frog-toolchain` v1.3.2 (GCC 16.2.0, binutils 2.47,
  uClibc-ng 1.0.59); host-global cross compilers are deliberately not used.
- UART console first.
- Initramfs first; SD rootfs later.
- No desktop stack, no package manager, no X11/Wayland during bring-up.

The versioned baseline is Linux 7.1.4, frog-toolchain GCC 16.2.0/binutils
2.47/uClibc-ng 1.0.59, BusyBox 1.38.0, and fb-test-app 1.1.1. Userspace is
ELF-only and defaults entirely to static-PIE `ET_DYN`. Fixed-address static
`ET_EXEC` is optional compatibility support enabled explicitly with
`FIXED_ET_EXEC=1`. `make toolchain` downloads the host-appropriate arm64 or
x86_64 frog-toolchain release, verifies its pinned SHA-256 digest, and
extracts it to a disposable prefix. The full rootfs then downloads and hashes
BusyBox and fb-test-app, assembles the curated base and overlay, and runs the
ELF audit. No package-generator or target compiler build is required.
The first kernel preparation uses a shallow, filtered checkout of the pinned
Linux stable tree on GitHub and creates a 25-MB-class slim source archive in
`.cache/`. The sparse checkout and the pruning script share their keep-lists,
so unused kernel blobs are not downloaded in the first place. CI caches that
archive so later clean runners skip the checkout and pruning pass. Set
`LINUX_SLIM_ARCHIVE` to place that derived cache elsewhere. If GitHub is not
available, set `LINUX_SOURCE_METHOD=archive` to use the verified kernel.org
tarball instead.

For a fully separated setup, every generated location can be supplied without
changing the source checkout:

```sh

  BUILD_DIR=/tmp/sf2000-build \

```

`JOBS` and `KERNEL_JOBS` default to the host CPU count, and ccache is enabled
by default in `.cache/ccache`; set `CCACHE_DIR` to share a cache between
worktrees or `USE_CCACHE=0` to disable it.

The default `FRONTEND_PROJECT=../sf2000_linux_frontend` keeps local builds
independent of checkout location. `make sdcard-zips` prints the resolved
Linux, frontend, JS2300, and QPSX revisions at the end and saves the same
provenance in `build/sf2000-linux-build-info.txt`.

The optional vendor ABI tests do not require a manually installed SDK:

```sh
make hcrtos-sdk
make check-vendor
```

For a completely separate dependency location, set both variables to the
same empty directory and the first command will populate it:

```sh
make HCRTOS_SDK_CACHE=/tmp/sf2000-hcrtos-sdk \
  HCRTOS_SDK_DIR=/tmp/sf2000-hcrtos-sdk hcrtos-sdk
```

Normal device boot enters the native browser as soon as input, display, and
the SD mount are ready. The retained-RAM loader log and `log.txt` recovery path
run before Linux and are unchanged; the old manual START+R step and diagnostic
console wait are not on the boot hot path. The initial menu provides Library,
Settings, Reset, and Safe Shutdown. START+SELECT belongs to the running
libretro host: it opens the pause/options menu rather than rebooting. Reset is
therefore explicit, and Safe Shutdown drains persistent logs, synchronizes and
unmounts FAT, blanks the display, and quiesces Linux before power is removed.

Runtime policy and browser theming share one typed configuration file:
`/etc/sf2000.conf`, optionally overridden by `/sf2000.conf` on the card. The
shipped file documents every key's type and range or finite enum. The staged
SD tree also contains `sf2000/ui.ttf` and its OFL license; the large Unicode
font is deliberately not embedded in every ASD. VFAT uses UTF-8 filename
conversion, and the browser supports English, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish,
Vietnamese, and Japanese labels.

Additional cores are SD packages, not boot-image payload. `make sdcard-linux`
stages them below `build/sdcard/sf2000/cores` with their licenses and includes
them in `SHA256SUMS`. The current verified packages are QuickNES, ProSystem,
Snes9x 2005, Snes9x 2002, Stella 2014, Gearboy, and PCE Fast. Opening
`.nes`, `.sfc`, or `.gb` content displays the corresponding core chooser; the
directory controls only the initial selection. QEMU launch gates stage
Gambatte, gpSP, and FCEUmm into their private test images when those tests
are run; none of these emulator cores is compiled into the boot ASD.
The browser also records a durable log checkpoint immediately before every
player/core `execve`; START+RIGHT requests the same checkpoint while the
browser or a running core is active. The logger independently recognizes the
chord, so it remains available even if a core hangs before its input loop.
This is useful when a core fails before the normal exit-time logger drain.
The QEMU `smoke-linux-quicknes` gate uses a ROM filename containing spaces and
verifies launch, a real 240x224 frame, clean exit, and absence of guest faults.

```

`smoke-linux-full-storage` now delegates to the sibling
`sf2000_qemu` raw-image DMA writeback smoke, so the default storage
regression path uses the stronger emulator-side oracle instead of the brittle
direct guest probe.

`smoke-linux-full-storage-enumeration` exercises the in-tree QEMU model
and Linux HC15 host together. It checks SCR DMA, SD card registration,
`mmcblk0`, and the first 4 KiB block read.

`smoke-linux-full-storage-probe-writeback` boots the minimal NOMMU
storage helper, writes through `mmcblk0`, flushes and reads the data back, and
then verifies the same signature in QEMU's SD image. Linux QEMU runs default
to the MIPS32r1 `4Km` fixed-mapping CPU model; `4Kc` models an R4000-style TLB
and is not an appropriate stand-in for the SF2000's MMU-less CPU.

Normal full-rootfs boots keep the detected VFAT card mounted at `/mnt/sd`. The
`sf2000-logd` service appends `/loglinux.txt` on that card. Every record carries
the 100 Hz monotonic tick, monotonic microseconds, process elapsed ticks, and
logger user/system CPU ticks. It drains `/dev/kmsg`, records input events and
USB/input topology changes, and samples CPU, memory, interrupt, uptime, load,
and VM counters from `/proc` every two seconds. A 512 KiB RAM buffer captures
the pre-mount boot and is committed once VFAT is ready; normal idle data is
committed after 128 KiB or two seconds, whichever occurs first.

The launcher uses a request/acknowledgement handshake with the logger before
starting the browser. The acknowledgement is published only after prior log
data has been synchronized. Until the browser and any selected emulator exit,
new kernel, input, heartbeat, and performance records stay in the bounded RAM
journal: the logger issues neither FAT writes nor `fsync`. It then records the
journal byte, peak, and dropped-byte counters and drains the complete journal.
Periodic frontend metrics use an append-only tmpfs spool instead of printk;
the logger imports that spool before the drain. This preserves detailed
telemetry across a core crash without synchronously feeding the slow serial
console from the real-time emulation thread. Each interval also publishes one
compact `frontend-audio` health word to the existing retained-RAM ring, so its
xrun and pacing-reset totals survive a quick power cycle without a syscall.
The supervisor owns this lifetime, so clean exit, core failure, and browser
failure all release it. Storage smoke targets retain explicit
destructive/readback coverage for development, but normal device boots do not
create a recurring test file.

`smoke-linux-full-asd` now covers the normal multi-exec init path through
the screen service's ready marker and rejects data-bus faults.
`smoke-linux-full-display` additionally requires a mode-6 RGB565 GMA
scanout and a captured 320x240 framebuffer. The kernel reserves that scanout
as a 320x240 RGB565 simple framebuffer and exposes it as `/dev/fb0`; the smoke
requires device registration and a successful userspace write through the
standard fbdev interface. The screen service still programs the vendor GMA
descriptors and panel registers directly. The MIPS NOMMU mapping path preserves
the uncached KSEG1 alias while validating it against the framebuffer physical
address, so ordinary applications can use fbdev `mmap` as well as `read`,
`write`, and ioctls.

The full image includes the upstream `fb-test-app` 1.1.1 utilities. Once
the physical display contract has been validated, normal boots retain the
working console instead of stopping it for diagnostic test screens. Append
`SF2000_FB_TEST=1` to the kernel command line to run `fb-test` automatically.
The broad MCU/GE and G1-G8 cards are available with `SF2000_GE_DIAG=1`, but
normal boot does not display or depend on them.

`SF2000_CONSOLE_SHELL=1` adds a login on the serial console next to the normal
application: init keeps starting the display, input, storage and frontend
services as usual and additionally runs a getty on `ttyS0`, so the browser or a
running core can be inspected from a shell. The command line is built into the
kernel, so this is a build-time choice like the flags above:

```sh
make ROOTFS=full SDCARD_ASD_SYNC=0 \
	LINUX_CMDLINE='console=ttyS0,115200 earlycon init=/init initramfs_async=0 \
SF2000_BOOT_VISUAL=browser SF2000_BOOT_COLOR=0x0000 SF2000_BOOT_HOLD_MS=750 \
SF2000_CONSOLE_SHELL=1' \
	LINUX_ASD=build/sf2000-linux-app-shell.asd linux-asd
```

Log in as `root` with an empty password. The shell owns the serial port only,
so the keypad still belongs to the frontend. `/proc` is not mounted on this
boot path, so `mount -t proc proc /proc` first if `ps` or `free` are needed.
Normal images are unaffected: without the flag no getty is started.

The missing production operation was found by tracing the closed firmware:
before its first GMA doorbell it clears the exact future scanout bitmap through
GE. The visible E2 diagnostic had accidentally done that in every sharp test
run. Production now performs that GE clear and render-to-scanout copy while the
ST7789 remains MCU-owned, starts VOU, alternates the two immutable 0x280-byte
descriptor blocks used by the vendor framebuffer driver, verifies both hardware
latches, transfers the panel to RGB mode, and completes four bounded userspace
TE/RAMWR boundaries. Steady RGB scanout then needs no panel interrupt.

The level-triggered kernel TE experiment was removed after physical log77
showed roughly 113 interrupts per second and recreated moving static by
repeatedly reclaiming the shared LCD bus. The display service sleeps through
all ordinary delays and redraw polling; it no longer consumes a core in a
diagnostic busy loop. GE performs full-screen clears and every presentation,
while idle console ticks redraw only the small changing regions.

The loader emits one health blink and then leaves the backlight off until the
display service has pushed a complete controlled frame. The first visible frame
is configurable:

```sh
# Immediate diagnostic console
make ROOTFS=full SF2000_BOOT_VISUAL=console sdcard-linux

# Black conditioning frame followed directly by the browser (default)
make ROOTFS=full SF2000_BOOT_VISUAL=browser sdcard-linux

# Built-in logo, held for 750 ms
make ROOTFS=full SF2000_BOOT_VISUAL=logo sdcard-linux

# RGB565 solid color, held for 1200 ms
make ROOTFS=full SF2000_BOOT_VISUAL=color \
	SF2000_BOOT_COLOR=0x001f SF2000_BOOT_HOLD_MS=1200 sdcard-linux
```

`SF2000_BOOT_HOLD_MS` is limited to five seconds. The logo is generated directly
into the framebuffer and adds no image decoder or filesystem dependency.
Use Reset or Safe Shutdown in the home menu to flush `loglinux.txt`,
synchronize and unmount the card. START+SELECT is reserved for the in-core
pause/options menu.

When explicitly enabled, init disarms the display watchdog, terminates the
console by its supervised PID, and waits for kernel-owned GE cleanup without
disturbing the live GMA descriptor. It then executes `fb-test -p 0` directly. No
intermediate shell, `killall`, or timeout process is involved in the handoff.
The expected final screen is a sharp test card with a green top edge, yellow
bottom edge, blue left field, red right field, RGB labels, and diagonals. The
`smoke-linux-full-fb-test` alias runs the full display smoke and checks
representative pixels in QEMU's continuously refreshed scanout. This covers a
real independently maintained static Linux ELF program, signal/child handling, all
eight o32 syscall argument slots, fbdev ioctls, framebuffer `mmap`, and CPU
writes becoming visible through the same GMA scanout used by the device. Add
`SF2000_FB_TEST=1` explicitly because the production default leaves the
accelerated console running.

`smoke-linux-full-audio` opens the in-kernel SF2000 ALSA PCM device from
NOMMU userspace, streams a 32 kHz S16 mono test signal through a coherent SND0
DMA ring, and requires QEMU's WAV backend to receive the guest samples.  The
same driver and device-tree node are used by the physical image.

The two HC15xx MUSB instances use the vendor endpoint layout (seven endpoints,
4 KiB FIFO RAM) and run as PIO host controllers. Their glue reproduces the
SF2000 vendor reset, shared-PHY trim, UTMI power, host-mode, and session-edge
sequence. Reset and PHY power run during platform initialization, while the ID
override and session edge run from the MUSB `set_mode` callback after core has
finished clearing `POWER` and `DEVCTL`. HC15xx uses opposite ID-override
polarity on its two ports: host mode sets USB0 UTMI bit 7 and clears USB1 UTMI
bit 6, matching the vendor `USB_DR_MODE_HOST` branch and the SF2000 USB-A
routing to USB1. The normal full-rootfs smoke
requires both USB buses to register. USB1 uses SYSINT sources 51 and 50,
matching the proven SF2000 firmware contract.
`sf2000-logd` dynamically opens `/dev/input/event0` through `event15`, so a
physical USB keyboard or mouse produces tick-stamped `source=input` records in
`/loglinux.txt` without taking exclusive ownership away from applications.
The on-screen console also refreshes all sixteen event nodes after hotplug,
reports each input device name, and displays key presses.

`smoke-qemu-unifrog` consumes the existing, read-only UniFrog build artifacts,
constructs a disposable FAT image under `build/`, and follows the persistent
boot-trace ABI through module initialization, storage completion,
JavaScript/frontend startup, and boot-logo presentation. Override
`UNIFROG_DIR` when that sibling checkout lives elsewhere.
The corresponding `*-display` targets capture QEMU's 320x240 panel after
frontend startup and reject an all-black pixel payload, covering continuous
GMA scanout of the framebuffer after its descriptor has been installed. They
then inject a D-pad down event, capture a second frame, and require the pixels
to change, covering the keypad-to-frontend redraw path as well.

`smoke-qemu-board-contract` runs the sibling `sf2000_qemu`
board-contract smoke, which keeps the board-profile, display, audio, USB, and
storage snapshots queryable from the Linux workspace as well.

`smoke-qemu-display` runs the sibling `sf2000_qemu` stock-display and
GB300-display smokes, giving the Linux workspace a direct
way to exercise the stronger display oracle without replaying the guest-side
panel boot chain.

`sdcard-linux` writes three intentionally different boot artifacts under
`build/sdcard`:

- `bios/bisrv.asd`: direct ROM boot. Copy this over the SD card
  `/bios/bisrv.asd` when bypassing fastboot/Unifrog.
- `firmware/unifrog.bin`: existing fastboot auto-load path. This is the raw
  loader binary, not an ASD image.
- `firmware/linux.asd`: Unifrog menu handoff path. Boot Unifrog first and
  select `linux.asd`.
- `log.txt`: fixed-size early boot log. Keep this file in the SD root if you
  want kernel stage names written back to the card.

Normal boots now use one loader health blink. Kernel and userspace milestones
continue to be recorded in the retained RAM journal and UART without delaying
boot or exposing stale panel memory. Warm recovery writes the newest 256
retained entries to `log.txt`; older entries are counted in a
`skipped-oldest` line instead of delaying boot with hundreds of sector writes.

See `docs/LOW-POWER.md` for the measured HC15xx idle limitation, wake-source
requirements, and the staged plan for safe clocked standby and suspend-to-RAM.

`make sdcard-zips` builds the full image once and creates two archives under
`build/`. The standalone archive contains `bios/bisrv.asd` and can be copied
directly to a card. The bootloader archive leaves that path untouched and
places the Linux image at
`system/firmware/frog2k-linux-<release-or-commit>.asd`, so it can be merged
with an SD card prepared by `sf2000_bootloader`. Set `SDCARD_RELEASE_ID` to
override the label; otherwise an exact Git tag is used, falling back to the
short commit ID.

The GitHub SD-card workflow selects the frontend using the same branch or tag
as Linux. It checks that the matching ref exists in both public repositories
before checkout, so development branches and release tags must be created in
both repositories before starting a build.

`make ci-fresh` clones the current committed Linux and frontend trees into a
temporary directory and builds the JS2300 userspace path with empty dependency
checkouts. This catches fresh-clone dependency-graph errors locally. To run
the complete package graph the same way, use
`make CI_FRESH_TARGET=sdcard-zips ci-fresh`; downloads and ccache remain in
the normal `.cache/` directory while build outputs and toolchains stay in the
temporary directory.
